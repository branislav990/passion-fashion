                    website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing
                    only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of

                    the materials; - use the materials for any commercial

                    the materials on any other server. 2. This license shall
                    automatically terminate if you violate any of these

                    FASHOIN PASSION Inc. makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and

                <h4>Limitations</h4>

                    of data or profit, or due to business interruption,) arising
                    out of the use or inability to use the materials on FASHOIN PASSION
                    Inc.'s Internet site, even if FASHOIN PASSION Inc. or a FASHOIN PASSION Inc.
                    authorized representative has been notified orally or in
                    writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some

                    warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
                    incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

                    reserves the right to change or modify any of the terms
                    contained in these terms & conditions, at any time. Any such
                    modifications or changes will immediately become effective
                    upon posting of such changes. Your continued access or use
                    of this Website will imply your full acceptance of the same.
                    You are therefore responsible for regularly reviewing these
                    Terms & Conditions and additional terms or notices posted on

                </p>
                <h4>Payment</h4>
                <p>
                    You agree to pay the full price for all products you
                    purchase from the website. You are responsible for the
                    timely payment of all fees and for providing us with a valid
                    credit card account for payment of all fees. FASHOIN PASSION accepts
                    American Express, Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and FASHOIN PASSION Gift
                    Cards.
                </p>
                <h4>Acceptance of Your Order</h4>
                <p>
                    Once you have made your choice and your order has been
                    placed, you will receive an email acknowledging the details
                    of your order. This email is NOT an acceptance of your
                    order, just a confirmation that we have received it. Unless
                    you cancel your order, acceptance of your order will be
                    perfected upon completion of the packing of your order.
                    Completion of the contract between you and FASHOIN PASSION, INC. will
                    be perfected when we dispatch the goods to you at which time
                    you will receive a second email containing you tracking
                    number, and confirming that your order has been dispatched.
                    The sale contract is therefore concluded in the State of
                    California, USA, and the language of the contract is
                    English. Neither our third party payment processor nor our
                    nominated courier has the authority to accept an order on
                    behalf of FASHOIN PASSION, INC. We reserve the right not to accept your
                    order in the event, for example, that we are unable to
                    obtain authorization for payment, that shipping restrictions
                    apply to a particular item, that the item ordered is out of
                    stock or does not satisfy our quality control standards and
                    is withdrawn, or that you do not meet the eligibility
                    criteria set-out within the TOS. Furthermore, we may refuse
                    to process a transaction for any reason or refuse service to
                    anyone at any time at our sole discretion. We will not be
                    liable to you or any third party by reason of our
                    withdrawing any merchandise from the Site whether or not
                    that merchandise has been sold, removing, screening or
                    editing any materials or content on the Site, refusing to
                    process a transaction or unwinding or suspending any
                    transaction after processing has begun. Whilst every effort
                    is made to make sure details on our website are accurate, we
                    may from time to time discover an error in the pricing of
                    products. If we discover an error in the pricing of a
                    product in your order, we will let you know as soon as
                    possible. We shall be under no obligation to accept or
                    fulfill an order for a product that was advertised at an
                    incorrect price and reserve the right to cancel such an
                    order that has been accepted or is in transit. If you order
                    a product that is priced incorrectly for any reason, we will
                    email or telephone you to inform you that we have not
                    accepted your order and/or that the relevant part of your
                    order has been cancelled. If you have already paid for the
                    goods, we shall refund the full amount as soon as we are
                    able. In the event that products are recalled in transit, we
                    will process your refund once the products have been
                    returned to us.
