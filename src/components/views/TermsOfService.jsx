                    1. Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of
                    the materials (information or software) on RUTI Inc.’s
                    website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing
                    only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of

                    the materials; - use the materials for any commercial

                    or - transfer the materials to another person or "mirror"
                    the materials on any other server. 2. This license shall
                    automatically terminate if you violate any of these
                    restrictions and may be terminated by RUTI Inc. at any time.
                    Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the
                    termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded
                    materials in your possession whether in electronic or
                    printed format.

                    The materials on RUTI Inc.’s website are provided "as is".
                    RUTI Inc. makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and
                    hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties, including

                    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
                    non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation
                    of rights. Further, RUTI Inc. does not warrant or make any
                    representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or
                    reliability of the use of the materials on its Internet

                <h3>Limitations</h3>
                <p>

                    any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss
                    of data or profit, or due to business interruption,) arising
                    out of the use or inability to use the materials on RUTI
                    Inc.'s Internet site, even if RUTI Inc. or a RUTI Inc.
                    authorized representative has been notified orally or in
                    writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some
                    jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
                    warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
                    incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

                    reserves the right to change or modify any of the terms
                    contained in these terms & conditions, at any time. Any such
                    modifications or changes will immediately become effective
                    upon posting of such changes. Your continued access or use
                    of this Website will imply your full acceptance of the same.
                    You are therefore responsible for regularly reviewing these
                    Terms & Conditions and additional terms or notices posted on

                </p>
                <h3>Payment</h3>
                <p>
                    You agree to pay the full price for all products you
                    purchase from the website. You are responsible for the
                    timely payment of all fees and for providing us with a valid
                    credit card account for payment of all fees. Ruti accepts
                    American Express, Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and Ruti Gift
                    Cards.
                </p>
                <h3>Acceptance of Your Order</h3>
                <p>
                    Once you have made your choice and your order has been
                    placed, you will receive an email acknowledging the details
                    of your order. This email is NOT an acceptance of your
                    order, just a confirmation that we have received it. Unless
                    you cancel your order, acceptance of your order will be
                    perfected upon completion of the packing of your order.
                    Completion of the contract between you and RUTI, INC. will
                    be perfected when we dispatch the goods to you at which time
                    you will receive a second email containing you tracking
                    number, and confirming that your order has been dispatched.
                    The sale contract is therefore concluded in the State of
                    California, USA, and the language of the contract is
                    English. Neither our third party payment processor nor our
                    nominated courier has the authority to accept an order on
                    behalf of RUTI, INC. We reserve the right not to accept your
                    order in the event, for example, that we are unable to
                    obtain authorization for payment, that shipping restrictions
                    apply to a particular item, that the item ordered is out of
                    stock or does not satisfy our quality control standards and
                    is withdrawn, or that you do not meet the eligibility
                    criteria set-out within the TOS. Furthermore, we may refuse
                    to process a transaction for any reason or refuse service to
                    anyone at any time at our sole discretion. We will not be
                    liable to you or any third party by reason of our
                    withdrawing any merchandise from the Site whether or not
                    that merchandise has been sold, removing, screening or
                    editing any materials or content on the Site, refusing to
                    process a transaction or unwinding or suspending any
                    transaction after processing has begun. Whilst every effort
                    is made to make sure details on our website are accurate, we
                    may from time to time discover an error in the pricing of
                    products. If we discover an error in the pricing of a
                    product in your order, we will let you know as soon as
                    possible. We shall be under no obligation to accept or
                    fulfill an order for a product that was advertised at an
                    incorrect price and reserve the right to cancel such an
                    order that has been accepted or is in transit. If you order
                    a product that is priced incorrectly for any reason, we will
                    email or telephone you to inform you that we have not
                    accepted your order and/or that the relevant part of your
                    order has been cancelled. If you have already paid for the
                    goods, we shall refund the full amount as soon as we are
                    able. In the event that products are recalled in transit, we
                    will process your refund once the products have been
                    returned to us.
